This is a Mobile Turnstile App that I developed during my software summer internship. Here is some information about the app:

Framework: Flutter & Dart
Only compatible with mobile phones which supports NFC reading feature
State Management: RxDart
HTTP requests: http package
Handled possible errors during runtime
Aimed to create an adaptive app
Utilized model classes to process data from the API
Emphasized readable code and a well-organized folder structure
Implemented adaptive height and weight to ensure compatibility with all screen sizes
