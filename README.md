This is a Mobile Turnstile App that I developed during my software summer internship. Here is some information about the app:<br />
<br />

Framework: Flutter & Dart<br />
<br />
Only compatible with mobile phones which supports NFC reading feature<br />
<br />
State Management: RxDart<br />
<br />
HTTP requests: http package<br />
<br />
Handled possible errors during runtime<br />
<br />
Aimed to create an adaptive app<br />
<br />
Utilized model classes to process data from the API<br />
<br />
Emphasized readable code and a well-organized folder structure<br />
<br />
Implemented adaptive height and weight to ensure compatibility with all screen sizes<br />
<br />
